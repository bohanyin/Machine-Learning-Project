"3.1","Main Characteristics data","Data description","The FAOSTAT domain Land Cover under the Agri-Environmental Indicators section contains land cover information organized by the land cover classes of the international standard system for Environmental and Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF). The land cover information is compiled from publicly available Global Land Cover (GLC) maps: a) the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP)-MODIS land cover type (2001–2012) and the European Spatial Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) annual land cover maps (1992–2015) produced by the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL)-Geomatics."

"3.4","Main Characteristics data","Statistical concepts and definitions","Land is a central component of economic and environmental accounting. As defined by the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF) land is “a unique environmental asset that delineates the space in which economic activities and environmental processes take places and within which environmental assets and economic assets are located”. Land cover refers to the observed physical and biological land cover of the Earth’s surface, and includes natural vegetation and abiotic (non-living) surfaces (SEEA CF, 5.257). The land cover classification of the SEEA CF currently is the international standard to prepare the physical accounts for land cover. The SEEA Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries SEEA-AFF (FAO, 2016), which was adopted in June 2016 by the UNCEEA as an ""Internationally Approved Methodological Document"" in support of the SEEA CF, also applies the land cover classification of the SEEA CF.  In the scope of the SEEA CF and SEEA AFF, land cover information is relevant for understanding the changing composition and condition of countries ecosystems, including its agricultural and forest landscape. A physical asset account for land cover with opening stocks, additions and reductions to stock, recording of net changes and closing stock is formulated in the SEEA AFF (Table 4.9 Physical land cover asset account)."

The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the rationale: ""If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time."""
