# Machine-Learning-Project

Thank you for reviewing our project! Early detection and prevention will be of utmost importance in reducing the loss triggered by wildfire. To achieve this, this research project aims to leverage multiple machine learning methods to develop a predictive modeling of wildfires by using data collected from satellite images and weather stations throughout 2019-2020.

This repository contains 3 folders:

- Data: the data contains two types: Climate data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  and  fire occurrence data from NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS)
- Code: the code contains three parts: [01_Data Cleaning_Temp and Prep](./Final Code/01_Data Cleaning_Temp and Prep.R); [01_Data Cleaning_Wildfire Precedents](./Final Code/01_Data Cleaning_Wildfire Precedents.R); [02_Modeling](./Final Code/02_Modeling.R)
- Output: only includes the clustering result in a csv file.
